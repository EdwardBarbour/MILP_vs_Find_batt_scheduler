# MILP_vs_Find_batt_scheduler
Uses data from the data driven battery scheduling competition; introduces battery scheduling using MILP.

Firstly, unzip the submit.csv file and put the contained csv files in the submit folder. <br>
Secondly, run the Optimizing_battery_schedule_using_pyomo.ipynb file.

Hopefully the code is pretty well documented in the notebook. This post (http://energystoragesense.com/uncategorized/scheduling_batt_optimisation/) accompanies the code.
